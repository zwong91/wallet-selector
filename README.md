## Installation and Usage

The easiest way to use NEAR Wallet Selector is to install the [`core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@near-wallet-selector/core) package from the NPM registry, some packages may require `near-api-js` v1.0.0 or above check them at [`packages`](./packages)

```bash
# Using Yarn
yarn add near-api-js

# Using NPM.
npm install near-api-js
```

```bash
# Using Yarn
yarn add @near-wallet-selector/core

# Using NPM.
npm install @near-wallet-selector/core
```

Next, you'll need to install the wallets you want to support:

```bash
# Using Yarn

```bash
# Using Yarn
yarn add @near-wallet-selector/modal-ui

# Using NPM.
npm install @near-wallet-selector/modal-ui
```

## Contributing

Contributors may find the [`examples`](./examples) directory useful as it provides a quick and consistent way to manually test new changes and/or bug fixes.

More details around contributing to this project can be found [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Editor Setup

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)) to enforce a consistent coding style. It's important that you configure your editor correctly to avoid issues when you're ready to open a Pull Request.

Although this project uses Prettier, it's simply an "internal" dependency to our ESLint configuration. This is because we want Prettier to handle code styling while avoiding conflicts with ESLint which specifically focuses on potentially problematic code. As a result, **it's important that you switch off Prettier in your editor and ensure only ESLint is enabled**.
